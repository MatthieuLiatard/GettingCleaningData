# Description of the data contents

## Labelling variable
These variables describe the type of use and the user on each row.

* Label: Type of activity performed by the subject
* SubjectId: Identification number of the subject (from 1 to 30)

## Accelerometer data
These data points are the tri-axial accelerometer output on total acceleration, acceleration net of gravity, and angular acceleration on the accelerometer.
All mean and standard deviations are computed by measure window of 128 observation and are then averaged over all observation windows for each user and activity.

* BodyAccX_Mean: Mean of the total acceleration corrected by the gravity (x axis)
* BodyAccX_SD: Mean of standard deviations of the total acceleration corrected by the gravity (x axis)
* BodyAccY_Mean: Mean of the total acceleration corrected by the gravity (y axis)
* BodyAccY_SD: Mean of standard deviations of the total acceleration corrected by the gravity (y axis)
* BodyAccZ_Mean: Mean of the total acceleration corrected by the gravity (z axis)
* BodyAccZ_SD: Mean of standard deviations of the total acceleration corrected by the gravity (z axis)
* bodyGyrox_Mean: Mean of the angular acceleration  (x axis)
* bodyGyrox_SD: Mean of standard deviations of the angular acceleration  (x axis)
* bodyGyroy_Mean: Mean of the angular acceleration  (y axis)
* bodyGyroy_SD: Mean of standard deviations of the angular acceleration  (y axis)
* bodyGyroz_Mean: Mean of the angular acceleration  (z axis)
* bodyGyroz_SD: Mean of standard deviations of the angular acceleration  (z axis)
* TotalAccx_Mean: Mean of the total acceleration  (x axis)
* TotalAccx_SD: Mean of standard deviations of the total acceleration (x axis)
* TotalAccy_Mean: Mean of the total acceleration  (y axis)
* TotalAccy_SD: Mean of standard deviations of the total acceleration (y axis)
* TotalAccz_Mean: Mean of the total acceleration  (z axis)
* TotalAccz_SD: Mean of standard deviations of the total acceleration (z axis)
